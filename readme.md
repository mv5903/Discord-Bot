Using this bot, you can make it perform a wide variety of tasks! Here are a list of commands that I have implemented for my Discord bot:

	* Open this help message again.

The possibilities are endless! I use [Heroku]  (https://www.heroku.com/home)  to host my bot, so that when I make a change to my bot.js file and commit the changes to GitHub, it will automatically restart to bot to reflect the new changes!
